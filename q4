//You are developing a booking application for a cinema. The ticket price depends on the type of the viewer("child", "adult", or "senior"). Write a program which calculates the price accordingly and prints the total price to be paid. Letâ€™s assume the ticket price for a child is Rs100, adult ticket price is Rs150 and ticket price for a senior is Rs120.

let numberofchilds = 2;
let numberofadults = 1;
let numberofseniors = 1;

let childprice = 100
let adultprice = 150
let seniorprice = 120

let totalticket = (numberofchilds*childprice + numberofadults*adultprice + numberofseniors*seniorprice)
console.log("Total ticket price is " +totalticket)
